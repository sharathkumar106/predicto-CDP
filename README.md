## Abstract

Environmental parameters like humidity, temperature, rainfall, wind flow, light intensity,
soil pH are main factors for precision agriculture. The real-time update will alert the
farmer by indicating which crop is in trouble, so the expenses on insecticides, pesticides
will reduce and overall economic condition of farmers will improve. Different sensors
collect the real-time data of environmental parameters like temperature, humidity,
rainfall, light intensity. Utilizing these data, crop diseases are predicted using machine
learning algorithms. 

The data extracted from various instances of
diseased and healthy crops can be used to compare with the real-time data to classify and
predict the probability of disease occurrence in the region.

### Software Requirements

# User Manual

In the results section, the users will be provided with the score determined by the
model. The score is a number ranging from 1 to 10 which will quantize the probability of
crops being infected with diseases in the future. The scores are categorized into the
following three sub-ranges:
● Range 1 - 3 (No or Very Less): There is almost no possibility for the crops to get
infected. The user need not worry at the moment.
● Range 4 - 6 (Yes): There are a few possibilities that may lead to the crops being
infected. The user is advised to consult the authorities and take minimum
precautions.
● Range 6 - 10 (Yes and High Risk): There is a high possibility that the plants will
get infected. The user is advised to consult the authorities and take suitable
precautions immediately.
The system thus enables a simple and elegant way to analyse and predict the possibility of
disease infection to the crops.
